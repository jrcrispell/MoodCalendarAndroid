### Android MOOD CALENDAR README ###
## Explanation ##
This is the Android version of my final project for the Mobile Development degree at Full Sail. Mood Calendar is an app concept I came up, inspired by a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy technique for people with depression. You simply record what you do throughout the day, and how it affects your mood (with a 1-10 score).
Not only does this give insight into how your habits affect your mood, but it's also a sort of work-out for your prefrontal cortex - the part of your brain that controls executive functions such as decision making, planning, and delay of gratification. By becoming more mindful you begin to consciously choose to spend your time in healthier ways, as opposed to just reactively binge watching Netflix because you feel like crap, and end up feeling worse because you feel like your day has been wasted.
